# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and policies implemented in the Clean Architecture solution. Security is a top priority, and this solution follows industry-standard practices for authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure development.

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Security
- **Algorithm**: HMAC SHA-256 for token signing
- **Key Length**: Minimum 256-bit secret key required
- **Token Expiration**: Short-lived access tokens (60 minutes default)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Secure rotation mechanism with 7-day expiration
- **Token Revocation**: Immediate revocation on logout
- **Secure Storage**: HttpOnly cookies recommended for production

### Password Security
- **Minimum Requirements**: 6 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character
- **Hashing**: ASP.NET Core Identity with PBKDF2
- **Account Lockout**: 5 failed attempts, 5-minute lockout
- **Password History**: Prevents reuse of recent passwords

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users get minimum required permissions
- **Role Hierarchy**: SuperAdmin > Admin > User
- **Claim-Based Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions
- **Route Protection**: Both API and frontend route guards

## üõ°Ô∏è API Security

### Rate Limiting
```json
{
  "GeneralRules": [
    {
      "Endpoint": "*",
      "Period": "1m",
      "Limit": 100
    },
    {
      "Endpoint": "*/api/auth/*",
      "Period": "1m", 
      "Limit": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### CORS Configuration
- **Allowed Origins**: Explicitly configured, no wildcards in production
- **Credentials**: Allowed for same-origin requests only
- **Headers**: Restricted to necessary headers
- **Methods**: Limited to required HTTP methods

### Request Validation
- **Model Validation**: FluentValidation with comprehensive rules
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatic XSS protection
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Entity Framework parameterized queries
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation and size limits

### HTTPS Enforcement
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
- **Secure Cookies**: All cookies marked as secure in production
- **Certificate Validation**: Proper SSL/TLS configuration

## üîí Data Protection

### Database Security
- **Connection Strings**: Stored in environment variables, never in code
- **Parameterized Queries**: EF Core prevents SQL injection
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted database backups

### Audit Logging
- **Change Tracking**: All entity modifications logged
- **User Attribution**: Every change linked to user ID
- **Tamper-Proof**: Audit logs in separate MongoDB collection
- **Retention Policy**: Configurable log retention periods

### Soft Delete
- **Data Preservation**: Soft delete for sensitive entities
- **Query Filters**: Automatic exclusion of deleted records
- **Recovery**: Ability to restore accidentally deleted data

## üö® Error Handling & Logging

### Global Exception Handling
- **ProblemDetails**: RFC 7807 compliant error responses
- **Information Disclosure**: No sensitive data in error messages
- **Correlation IDs**: Traceable requests for debugging
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Generic messages for security errors

### Security Logging
```csharp
// Security events logged
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Authorization failures
- Token generation/refresh/revocation
- Administrative actions
- Suspicious activity patterns
```

### Log Security
- **Structured Logging**: Serilog with multiple sinks
- **Log Rotation**: Daily rotation with size limits
- **Access Control**: Restricted access to log files
- **Sensitive Data**: No passwords or tokens in logs

## üîç Monitoring & Detection

### Health Checks
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Database, Redis, MongoDB connectivity
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and error rates
- **Security Metrics**: Failed authentication attempts
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for security incidents

### Anomaly Detection
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic blocking of suspicious requests
- **Pattern Recognition**: Unusual access patterns
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Unexpected login locations
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Off-hours access monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Security

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated
- **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused peer reviews

### Secrets Management
- **Environment Variables**: No secrets in source code
- **User Secrets**: Development secrets in secure storage
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of signing keys
- **Access Control**: Limited access to production secrets

### Docker Security
- **Base Images**: Official, regularly updated images
- **Non-Root User**: Applications run as non-root
- **Minimal Images**: Only necessary components included
- **Security Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans
